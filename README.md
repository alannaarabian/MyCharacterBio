Big Picture

Ultimately this project will benefit method actors and help them create a character bio. Method actor use character bios to get to know their characters and to truly become them. It will work like an online job interview. It will ask questions one after the other, and the user should answer them as their character. This information will be gathered in a list, or may be programmed so that way the information is put into a paragraph in a summary like formation. 


First Round

The very first thing I had to do was think of twenty questions that would be relevant enough to ask a person. In the first round, I hoped to accomplish figuring out how I could program this so that way a new questions appeared after the user answered the previous one. I also wanted to have the questions and answers be in the two different colors in the end. 


Test Plan for 1st Round

This is a detailed test for test users to follow. The first thing you need to do is type the name of your character, then press enter. Answer the next twenty questions as if you were your character in real life. Once you have completed the questions, they will show up in a list with the questions colored blue and the answers colored red. You can choose to print it out or to email it to your phone. Another option would be to have all of your answers be put into a paragraph, in a summary like form. 


Reflexions and Revisions

I successfully was able to do everything accept program it so the user could have the option of putting their information into a paragraph. That is what I need to work on next.


Next Steps

I hope to accomplish, like I said before, programming it so the user could have the choice of putting their information into a paragraph form. I hope this will eventually lead to a program that can help actors find scenes and monologues that work best for themselves. Meaning that they will not only get asked questions about their characters but also questions about who they are and what they like etc.
